								<h2> <b>The Stroy of Origin</b></h2>
							</div>

							<div class="blog-desc">								
								<p>Welcome to the fascinating world of Water! Even if we are surrounded by water in our everyday life, there is much less we actually know about it. So, let’s go back into the history to find out from where our source of life came from... </p>
								
								<blockquote class="default">
									“A drop of water, if it could write out its own history, would explain the universe to us.” <br/> – Lucy&nbspLarcom
								</blockquote>
								<br/>
								
								<h2>The Dust Settles..</h2>
								<p>It was 375,000 years after the big bang, universe started to cool down, and there were a lot of debries and rocks scattered across the cosmos, those began to attract each other due to gravity, to form planets. But those planets didn't have any water or life.</p>
								<p>The first known occurrence of water on our planet dates back 4.5 billion years!! Yes, unbelievable right? Water has been on our planet for a very long period of time, even a long time before the dinosaurs.</p>
								<p>So the question is, how does the water got here in the first place? There are many theories that tells the origin of water, but the most popular is asteroids Impacts. Yes, billions of years ago, Earth was bombarded by multiple asteroids from space!</p>
								<br/>

								<h2>The Impact..!</h2>
								<p>To understand it, imagine an army of rocks, coming fast towards our planet. Don’t worry, there was no life on Earth at that time. Earth was just another floating rock in the Solar System, which looked like the current surface of the moon. These asteroids that came to Earth were comprised of icy molecules.</p>
								<p>The Asteroid was made of three layers, the innermost layer was the rocky core, the middle layer was the H2O rich mineral composition, and the outermost layer was the Silicate surface. Currently we use silicate to improve the hardness of surface of an object, which explains the durability of the H2O rich material, while the asteroid would have travelled into the space.</p>
								<p>Now, when theses asteroids reached the Earth’s surface, there would have been a series of big explosions on impact of asteroids. It would have been a big battleground!</p>
								<br/>

								<h2>Another Perspective..!</h2>
								<p>But, according to new findings, this may not be the only way of water origin on Earth. Another theory tells us, that some billions of years ago, massive icy asteroids containing water started creating into planets while a large solar nebula was swirling around the Sun. These asteroids must have had multiple collisions and evolved at a massive rate before it transformed into the ocean of magma. This celestial body in the end turned into Earth. </p>
								<p>Small asteroids and other celestial bodies continued to collide onto Earth, which further added more water and rocks. This process helped the planet until it reached its final size that we see today.</p>
								<br/>

								<h2>Life gets a chance..</h2>
								<p>The obvious question now is, why the water did not get vaporized during the impact? The impact must have triggered the explosions and exerted heat in the atmosphere. But the water managed to survive regardless.</p>
								<p>According to a recent demonstration carried out by NASA, on "Impact of Asteroid", proved that the Asteroid impacts did not create an exothermic reaction, but instead, in less than second of the impact, the water in asteroid got suspended in the atmosphere and some of the water even got trapped in the rocks.</p>
								<p>Those rocks may still be in Earth, containing the water. This is one of the theory that explains the occurrence of large amount of underground water on Earth.</p>
								<br/>

								<h2>More Mystery..!</h2>
								<p>As you can see, these theories are somewhat similar, but, there could be more unknown variables that we do not know about yet and have a great impact on the origin of water. Our space is filled with amazing mysteries, and water is one of them. There are still large reservoirs of water floating around in space! Amazing isn’t it? </p>
								<p>On the ending note, I would like to say.. Always be thirsty..!! (For knowledge of course) and keep exploring!</p>

								<blockquote class="fact">
									<span class="do-you-know">Do you know</span>, that there are some simple organisms that can exist without air? But, they cannot exist without water..!!
